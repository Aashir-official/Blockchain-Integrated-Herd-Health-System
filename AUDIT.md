# Frontend Audit: BIHHS static site

Date: 2025-10-03

Overview
- Project type: Static HTML/CSS/JS (no package.json or build tooling)
- Main entry points:
  - index.html (marketing/landing)
  - pages/login.html (user login)
  - pages/signup-farm-owner.html (registration)
  - pages/signup-cattle-company.html (registration)
  - pages/dashboard.html (user dashboard)
  - pages/admin-dashboard.html (admin dashboard)
- Core assets:
  - CSS: assets/css/styles.css, assets/css/responsive.css, assets/css/auth.css, assets/css/dashboard.css, assets/css/admin.css
  - JS: assets/js/main.js, assets/js/dashboard.js, assets/js/admin-dashboard.js

Validation & auth-related code
- Client-side validation helpers in assets/js/main.js:
  - validateFullName, validatePhone, validatePassword, validateEmailOrPhone
  - New inline UX helpers added: setFieldError, clearFieldError, markFieldValid, validateInput, attachAuthValidation, displayServerErrors
- Form handlers:
  - handleLogin(event) — preserves redirect to dashboard.html
  - handleSignup(event, userType) — preserves redirect to dashboard.html

Theme / variables
- Theme variables scoped to dashboards only (no global override):
  - Defined in .dashboard-body and .admin-body in assets/css/dashboard.css and assets/css/admin.css
  - Variables: --bg-midnight, --panel-dark, --accent-star, --accent-warm, --muted-text, --text-white, --error, --success, --surface

Dashboard components
- User: tabs (dashboard, herds, analytics, certificates, settings), stats cards, filter buttons, charts placeholders
- Admin: overview, users, collars, activity, reports, system — cards/tables with actions

Risk areas
- No version control initialized — cannot create branch/PR until repo is a git repository
- No build tool (no npm/package.json) — cannot run linter/minifier automatically; optimization performed by manual edits
- Global styles in assets/css/styles.css define .btn and layout; dashboard-specific overrides must stay scoped to .dashboard-body/.admin-body to avoid regressions (done)
- JS uses direct DOM manipulation; brittle selectors if HTML structure changes
- No automated tests framework present

Planned/applied changes
- Forms (login + both signups):
  - Removed always-visible condition text from Name and Password labels only
  - Added inline validation on blur and submit with aria-live regions and error containers
  - First invalid field focuses on submit; subtle success state via .is-valid border
- Validation UX implementation: assets/js/main.js updated (no backend logic changed)
- Server error surface: displayServerErrors(form, errors) helper provided for future integration
- Dashboard/admin theme:
  - Scoped variables and applied palette; nav uses --panel-dark; cards use --surface; buttons use --accent-star
  - Kept layout and behaviors unchanged
- Optimization steps: removed console.log and debug output from assets/js/dashboard.js

Next steps / notes
- To create a PR, initialize git and set a remote; see QA and delivery section
- If you want asset minification/linting, we can add a lightweight npm toolchain (esbuild + stylelint) as a dev-only step, scoped to build outputs
